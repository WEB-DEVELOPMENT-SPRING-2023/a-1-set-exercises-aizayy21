			<h2>Reviews</h2>
			<p>" thanks to the excellent array of characters played by excellent actors,
				   the inventive new twist on the Addams Family formula, and regard for the original material.
				    It's true what you've heard about this show; it's fantastic.

				Do yourself a favor and stop reading these reviews if you want to enjoy the show. From beginning to end, it is a thrill.
